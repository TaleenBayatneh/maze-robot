We started by implementing a more advanced algorithm. After thoroughly testing all hardware components, we decided to combine the left-hand wall-following rule with a position tracking mechanism to prevent the robot from navigating blindly. The main strategy is for the robot to always follow the left wall when a path is available. If a left turn is detected, it performs a 90-degree turn and moves forward. To handle dead ends, we use a front-facing VL53L0X distance sensor: if the robot detects a wall within 8 cm, it performs a 180-degree turn to reverse direction.
